# String resource file 
#
# When processed by the String Resource Tool, this file generates
# both a .CS and a .RESX file with the same name as the file.
# The .CS file contains a class which can be used to access these 
# string resources, including the ability to format in 
# parameters, which are identified with the .NET {x} format
# (see String.Format help).  
#
# Comments below assume the file name is SR.strings.
#
# Lines starting with a semicolon ";" are also treated as comments, but
# in a future version they will be extracted and made available in LocStudio
# Put your comments to localizers _before_ the string they apply to.
#
# SMO build specific comment
# after generating the .resx file, run srgen on it and get the .resx file
# please remember to also check that .resx in, along with the 
# .strings and .cs files
